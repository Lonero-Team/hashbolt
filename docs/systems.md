It is important to reiterate that all masternodes are still nodes within the network and part of the computational pipeline that make up Lonero. This has been mentioned many times prior, but is worth reiterating. Masternodes act as an extension to Lonero's network, and help compliment it. HashBolt is designed to be modularly adaptable, extendable and buildable. This means upgrading over time should be quite simple.
