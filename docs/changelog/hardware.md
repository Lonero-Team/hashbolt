# Hardware

Overall masternodes help in a core aspect of Lonero's ecosystem, and that is scalability. The more miners as well, the more scalable the network will also be. The most optimized OS to run masternodes are [Ubuntu 16.04+](https://ubuntu.com/), [Xubuntu 16.04+](https://xubuntu.org/), [Lubuntu 16.10+](https://lubuntu.net/), [Lonero OS (latest)](https://www.starkdrones.org/home/os) and [Fedora OS v33+](https://getfedora.org/). You can also run masternodes w/ [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or on the [Ubuntu terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows) for Windows 10. Many people prefer to run on a VPS or their own server at home w/ a static IP. Some people also run a virtual machine utilizing a program such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
