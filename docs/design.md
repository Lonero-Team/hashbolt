# Design

As mentioned prior, a core aspect of HashBolt is how it helps reduce network congestion. Infact, HashBolt is designed for speed, optimization, and compatibility. Having a low latency network and less lagging are very important in regards to P2P connectivity. Blockchain network latency and capacity are really fundemental problems. This is why it needs to be tackled from the ground up. HashBolt is modularly designed and built.
