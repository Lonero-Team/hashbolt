# Premise
Many different cryptocurrencies have masternodes that are unsustainable and doesn't help in adaptability in the long run. HashBolt aims to be different and to create an innovative way to limit network congestion on a blockchain network. We don't want a network centered around high fees or long transaction times. A core premise is that anybody can decide to run or upgrade to a masternode by locking LNR, but don't need to purchase the masternode in or of itself outside of the assets they are locking. This is different then many crytocurrencies that require you to pay loads of crypto upfront to get a masternode in hopes that it might increase in value.
