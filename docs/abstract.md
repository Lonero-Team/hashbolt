# Abstract
Current masternodes are incredibly inefficient and non-adaptable. Lonero's HashBolt aims to be a different type of masternode system. While people are mining, masternodes have the opportunity to work on making the network less congested. This is in part due to holding LNR for a certain time period and thus recieving more rewards. Lonero's mining system eventually wants to adapt to an experimental *"Proof of Computation"* mining algorithm so that everybody can participate in the network. Through a shared ecosystem, HashBolt's mechanism helps prevent giant fees, a slow network, and large wait times. There is an importance in regards to how much LNR is locked, time period, and how it effects network activity. It doesn't cost anything upfront to run a masternode outside of the LNR that you are locking. That LNR will still stay yours when unlocked. This is different than many networks that want you to pay loads of crypto upfront which limit long term adaption. Throughout the design of HashBolt, many mathematical proofs and certain protocols are followed in order to make HashBolt functional. These protocols and proofs help with measuring time elapsed, speed, efficiency and latency.
