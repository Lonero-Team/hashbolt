# Systems

HashBolt is built to run on a variety of systems and architectures including x32, x64, and x86 instruction sets. Along w/ miners, masternodes help speed up the network by keeping it less congested for the validation process. Hosting masternodes and locking LNR should be straight forward, and any compatibility issues that arise over time should be taken care of.
