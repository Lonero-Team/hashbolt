# About
**HashBolt** is a hybrid masternode consensus. Lonero's masternode consensus allow masternodes to receive mined rewards while holding LNR for a certain locked period in order to avoid network congestion. Lonero eventually wants compatibility w/ a *Proof of Computation* mining proof, that is in an experimental phase. We want to build the masternode system in a way that is accessible towards many, and can create a network of scale.

As noted, since you are locking LNR, you are rewarded incrementally on the basis of how you're contributing to network decongestion. We are implementing ways to track network load as well as load vs. expected load. Through this, HashBolt aims to be a stably growing system for network scalability.
