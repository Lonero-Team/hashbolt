# Masternodes and Consensus

All masternodes along w/ general nodes participate as a consensus and try optimally avoiding invalidated blocks. How the network is affected in regards to latency and efficiency, also plays a role in regards to the consensus agreement and timing. These processes are done automatically through the mathematical proofs and constraints put in place.
