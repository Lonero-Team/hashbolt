# Software Defined Networking Integrations

Lonero and its algorithms are modularly built and centered around a SDN approach to software development and integrations. Due to this, traditional management in regards to optimization, performance, resources and capabilities can be achieved. We are centered around tacking the SDN approach in all our software, and make many things modularly built in regards to how extendable the network is. This is especially true in regards to systems in place such as masternodes.
