# Ring Signatures

Ring signatures are a large part of the validation process for Lonero's network. HashBolt integrates similar ring signature validation. All masternodes have secure multipath layer validation schemes in order to access your node. This helps keep your LNR secure for a long period of time, and is a core aspect of the network.
