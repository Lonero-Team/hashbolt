# Encryption and Cryptography Schemes

The cryptography and encryption scheme of HashBolt is fairly complex in order to maximize security. Everything is built in a way where you don't have to trade-off security for optimization or speed and vice versa. Overtime, the encryption scheme will become more optmized and algorithmically efficient. As memtioned in a previous section, we do utilize mutliple pathwalls in regards to our cryptography.
