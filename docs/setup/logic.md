# The Logic

There is alot of logic regarding the mathematical and algorithmic principles related to HashBolt's overall design. There is also alot of formal logic in regards to HashBolt's design, including playing a role w/ network latency. For example, some formal logic is obvious when looking into things such as network efficiency. **If** fees are incrementally lowered **while** the network is validated, **then** calculate the fees lowered by X locked LNR and the reward proportionally. Network validation is in regards to **if** the block is solved, **then** move to the next block, rather then the block being invalidated. This is how we know if the validation is working, and the incremental impact the masternode is having in regards to speed and efficiency.
