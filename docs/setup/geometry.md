# Euclidean Geometry

In regards to network efficiency and validity, we are applying many concepts related to Euclidean geometry similar to the Euclidean algorithm. These help in regards to well defined cryptographic calculations. [Euclidean Geometry](https://lonero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Lonero/Crypto.html#applying-euclidean-geometry) will be applied to Lonero's blockchain in regards to a mathematical algorthic component. A similar type of mathematical component will be applied as part of the algorithmic system that distributes some LNR rewards accross different masternodes.
