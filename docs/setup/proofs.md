# Proofs

There are a series of mathematical proofs in regards to the HashBolt masternode consensus and how it plays a role in Lonero's network. These proofs are related to CHFs *"Cryptographic Hashing Functions"*, network latency, validation, and lattice-based proof systems. Also included are implementations of principals found in game theory, number theory and topological algebra.

$p(y|x) = \frac{p(y|x)}{p(x)}{p(x)}$

Everytime you divide the entire blockain's network time by the current time, then multiply it by the current time, you should get the entire blockchain's network time. However, the only way you are able to calculate current time is through epoch time and time dilation network complexity.  Epoch time is obviously the beginning of the network, but the point in regards to netowork complexity goes beyond epoch time. One needs to have a predictive mechanism in which one can predict when blocks can be solved. Many variables play a role in this, including network traffic, current epoch time, LNR locked, and mining rates.

$$
\operatorname{hashbolt} reward=\{x\in LNR:{p(y|x)}*e_{F}}{\mbox{.}}
$$

The hashbolt reward is proportional to the total time locked LNR times the efficiency of fees estimated by your masternode contribution. Once the network is able to do the calculations through its more complex mathematical formulas, these metrics are set in place for you start receiving rewards proportional for your contribution.
