# Understanding Schemes

The lock function for time locking LNR will have a cryptographic scheme and mechanism in and of itself. Once all the mathematical proofs are validated, which is done over time as the network matures, then you will have a general idea of the masternode reward after each n<sup>th</sup> block is validated. The idea is simple: once all the proofs are validated, a reward is given.
