# Intro

There are lots of mathematical implications in regards to HashBolt and how it will work. These implications include network latency, novel proofs, and even proofs regarding its integration within Lonero's overall network. Due to this, many variables will need to be taken into consideration. The variables in place will be derived in order to work well cryptographically within the network, and make sure HashBolt runs smoothly. This includes linear time optimization, novel methods of calculating network latency throughput on the blockchain, and various other techniques. These methods, calculations, and methodological systems is what will allow HashBolt to function the way that it is.
